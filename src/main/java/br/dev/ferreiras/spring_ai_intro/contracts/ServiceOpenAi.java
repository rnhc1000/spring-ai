/*
While the main purpose of @HttpExchange is to abstract HTTP client code with a generated proxy,
the HTTP Interface on which such annotations are placed is a contract neutral to client vs server use.
In addition to simplifying client code, there are also cases where an HTTP Interface may be a convenient
way for servers to expose their API for client access.
This leads to increased coupling between client and server and is often not a good choice, especially for public APIâ€™s,
but may be exactly the goal for an internal API.
It is an approach commonly used in Spring Cloud, and it is why @HttpExchange is supported as an alternative to
@RequestMapping for server side handling in controller classes.
@HttpExchange and @RequestMapping have differences.
@RequestMapping can map to any number of requests by path patterns, HTTP methods, and more, while @HttpExchange
declares a single endpoint with a concrete HTTP method, path, and content types.

For method parameters and returns values, generally, @HttpExchange supports a subset of the method parameters
that @RequestMapping does
